                <h2>Faction: Cultists</h2>
                <p>The cult believes the breakdown of the world is not a disaster- but a holy event, the long-awaited return cycle when all life will be reabsorbed into the life stream and offered to creation.
                    They see the current collapse-magic backlash, failing physics, vanishing people- not as horror, but as divine signs of awakening. To them, resisting is heresy. Prolonging life is sacrifice.
                    Their ultimate goal?
                    Accelerate the End by offering sacrifices to the machine-world and hastening its final "pulse"- a system-wide collapse that will "transmit" the harvested life-energy to the gods beyond the stars.
                    Life is fuel. Your body is a shell. Your spirit is a spark. Your true purpose is to burn brightly in your final moments.
                    Magic is sacred death. Casters are holy martyrs. The best among them burn out gloriously and instantly.
                    Sacrifice is salvation. Willingly giving your life ensures you are "broadcast" cleanly into the stream.
                    They kidnap the sick, the old, or magically-gifted people for noble release. Children are raised to view suicide as scared duty.</p>

                <h2>Faction: Rootbound</h2>
                <p>The Rootbound are a collective of nature fanatics bound—both spiritually and physically—to the will of the wild. Their sole purpose 
                    is to tear down the blight of industrialized and modernized society reducing steel and stone to dust, and returning the world to what 
                    they call “The True State.” They wield ancient nature magics, conjuring vines, beasts, and storms to reclaim lands lost to progress. 
                    To them, cities are scars upon the earth, and technology is a sickness to be purged. They don’t negotiate. They don’t build alliances. 
                    They uproot.

                <p>
                    Nomadic tribes of barbarians with shamanistic roots. They have connection to nature and use it to control mech suits. Each suit is alive 
                    using the spirit of the bear, crow, wolf, [insert animal]. They have a warrior culture and deep traditions. They don't seperate machine and spirit. 
                    They are one. Technology is used throuhgout their daily lives and spirits are weaved into tehcnology via rituals.
