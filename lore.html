                <p>A resource, a fuel, and a source of magic. It seeps from wells 
                    hidden in unstable zones, fought over by desperate factions. 
                    One group has synthesizes it- unsable and toxic. Another lives 
                    sealed in Thrym-fuled domes, surviving in polluted, 
                    hyper-industrialized wastelands.

                <p>Zealots who believe the collapse is holy. Sacrifice is salvation. Magic is sacred death. They 
                    hasten the system's end to "broadcast" life to the stars. Monstrous ascendants are born from 
                    flesh offerings and eldritch communion.
