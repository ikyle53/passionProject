                <h3>Core Concept and Theme</h3>
                <p>Define the setting and narrative. Will it 
                    be sci-fi, fantasy, historical, or something
                    unique?
                </p>
                <p>Establish why players are fighting. Are there
                    factions with distinct motivations?
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-tree fa-4x"></i>
                <h3>Scale and Scope</h3>
                <p>What's the game's scale? 5-20 models per side?
                    Large battles with 50+ models?</p>
                <p>What's a typical game size? A board sized at 
                    2' x 2'? 4' x 4'? What fits the narrative and 
                    objectives?</p>
                <p>Consider playtime as well. 1-2 hours sounds 
                    like a good time</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-flask fa-4x"></i>
                <h3>Core Mechanics</h3>
                <p>What would be a good resolution system: dice,  
                    cards, hybrid? How will actions be decided?</p>
                <p>Define the turn structure: alternating activation, 
                    I go you go (IGOUGO), or something completely new?</p>
                <p>Stats and attributes for units will need to 
                    determined. Simplicity wins but also needs flexibility 
                    for variety.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-dice fa-4x"></i>
                <h3>Faction and Unit Variety</h3>
                <p>Start with a few starting factions that have 
                    unique playstyles (eg., fast vs tough)</p>
                <p>What are the unit roles (if any)? Leader, specialists, 
                    grunts. How will they differ mechanically?</p>
                <p>Gotta make sure faction asymmetry feels balanced- 
                    each should have strengths and weaknesses.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-dice fa-4x"></i>
                <h3>Objective and Conditions</h3>
                <p>How will players win: kill points, objectives, 
                    or narrative goals?</p>
                <p>Need to plan for varied missions to keep games replayable. 
                    This could come in the form of randomization via an app.</p>
                <p>Can we balance competetive and casual play? Can we appeal to 
                    multiple motives?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-dice fa-4x"></i>
                <h3>Terrain and Environments</h3>
                <p>How will terrain impact gameplay? Will there be rules like 
                    cover, line of sight, or movement penalties?</p>
                <p>Will terrain be fixed or flexible layout? Does it matter?</p>
                <p>Will there be environment effects? Weather, traps, or other element like collapsing bridges.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-dice fa-4x"></i>
                <h3>Progression and Customization</h3>
                <p>Can players cusomize units (gear, skills, names, etc) or build rosters?</p>
                <p>Is there a level up system to gain xp to gain new things/skills?</p>
                <p>Keep in mind- Depth of the system may overwhelm some players, 
                    especially new players. Gotta have an attrative system with simplicity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-dice fa-4x"></i>
                <h3>Accessibility and Components</h3>
                <p>I like the idea of digital rules</p>
                <p>I also like the idea of digital list building</p>
                <p>What physical components would be needed? 
                    (Dice, app, tokens, measuring tools)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-dice fa-4x"></i>
                <h3>Playtesting Framework</h3>
                <p>Whats the plan to test mechanics?</p>
                <p>Should we include outsiders (community playtesting)?</p>
                <p>How can we get good feedback?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-dice fa-4x"></i>
                <h3>Uniqueness</h3>
                <p>What is going to make our game stand out compared to every 
                    other game? Is it novel mechanics? A fresh setting? Good rules? 
                    No politically motivated bias?</p>
                <p>I'd prefer to focus more on comunity than anything else. The game won't exist unless people exist to play it.</p>
