        <h1>Passion Project</h1>
            <p>This is a prject for creating a new tabletop game as designed by friends and family.</p>
            <p>Please take the following as if it were wet clay. Nothing is set in stone and all things are up for interpretation, discussion, feedback, and fixing.
                I want to start this project because I want to be close to you (my friends) and have a creative outlet where we're not subjected to weird motivations 
                from third parties, companies, and politics.
            </p>

        <h2>Foundations</h2>
            <p>The passion project is split into the following
            ideas to create a foundation for all the details
            to stand on.

        <h2>Core Concept and Theme objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Define the setting and narrative. Will it 
                    be sci-fi, fantasy, historical, or something
                    unique?
                </li>
                <li>Establish why players are fighting. Are there
                    factions with distinct motivations?
                </li>
            </ul>
    </section>

    <section class = "idea" id="scale_scope">
        <h2>Scale and Scope</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>What's the game's scale? 5-20 models per side?
                    Large battles with 50+ models?
                </li>
                <li>What's a typical game size? A board sized at 
                    2' x 2'? 4' x 4'? What fits the narrative and 
                    objectives?
                </li>
                <li>Consider playtime as well. 1-2 hours sounds 
                    like a good time.
                </li>
            </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="idea2" id="mechanics">
        <h2>Core Mechanics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>What would be a good resolution system: dice, 
                    cards, hybrid? How will actions be decided?
                </li>
                <li>Define the turn structure: alternating  activation,
                    I go you go (IGOUGO), or something completely new?
                </li>
                <li>Stats and attributes for units will need to determined.
                    Simplicity wins but also needs flexibility for variety.
                </li>
            </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="idea" id="factions">
        <h2>Factions and Unit Variety</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with a few starting factions that have
                    unique playstyles (eg., fast vs tough)
                </li>
                <li>What are the unit roles (if any)? Leader, 
                    specialists, grunts. How will they differ
                    mechanically?
                </li>
                <li>Gotta make sure faction asymmetry feels 
                    balanced- each should have strengths and
                    weaknesses.
                </li>
            </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="idea2" id="objectives">
        <h2>Objectives and win conditions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>How will players win: kill points, objectives, 
                    or narrative goals? 
                </li>
                <li>Need to plan for varied missions to keep games 
                    replayable. This could come in the form of 
                    randomization via an app.
                </li>
                <li>Can we balance competetive and casual play? 
                    Can we appeal to multiple motives?
                </li>
            </ul>

    <section class="idea" id="terrain">
        <h2>Terrain and Environments</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>How will terrain impact gameplay? Will there 
                    be rules like cover, line of sight, or movement 
                    penalties?
                </li>
                <li>Will terrain be fixed or flexible layout? Does 
                    it matter?
                </li>
                <li>Will there be environment effects? Weather, 
                    traps, or other element like collapsing bridges.
                </li>
            </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="idea2" id="progress">
        <h2>Progression and Customization</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can players cusomize units (gear, skills, 
                    names, etc) or build rosters?
                </li>
                <li>Is there a level up system to gain xp to
                    gain new things/skills?
                </li>
                <li>Keep in mind- Depth of the system may overwhelm 
                    some players, especially new players. Gotta have 
                    an attrative system with simplicity.
                </li>
            </ul>

    <section class="idea" id="accessibility">
        <h2>Accessibility and Components</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I like the idea of digital rules</li>
                <li>I also like the idea of digital list building</li>
                <li>What physical components would be needed? (Dice, 
                    app, tokens, measuring tools)
                </li>
            </ul>

    <section class="idea2" id="playtest">
        <h2>Playtesting framework</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Whats the plan to test mechanics?</li>
                <li>Should we include outsiders (community 
                    playtesting)?
                </li>
                <li>How can we get good feedback?</li>
            </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="idea" id="point">
        <h2>Unique selling point</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm not assuming we'll be selling anything 
                    or making a profit. This is for enjoyment 
                    first and foremost. No expectations!
                </li>
                <li>What is going to make our game stand out 
                    compared to every other game? Is it novel 
                    mechanics? A fresh setting? Good rules? 
                    No politically motivated bias?
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'd prefer to focus more on comunity than 
                    anything else. The game won't exist unless 
                    people exist to play it.
                </li>
